    Unplug -- An Essential Tool for Rapid Plugin Development
    ========================================================

Overview
--------

  This plugin is a completely flexible plugin framework that displays a
page built from content read from an ElectricCommander property.

  Typical uses include implementing a simple "News of the Day" or status
page for ElectricCommander users, performing rapid prototyping of plugin
logic as well as plugin presentation, and serving as a training aid to
speed learning about ElectricCommander plugins and how they work.

Quick Installation
------------------

  Download the plugin jar file, then install and promote the plugin in
the normal fashion.  Once promoted, click on your user name (in the
upper right corner of the Commander Web UI), and select "Edit Settings"
on your User Details page.  Select "Unplug View" from the "Tab View"
list box, and click "OK".  A new sub-tab (named "Un") should appear
beneath your normal Home tab in the UI.

Obtaining Help
--------------

  Help documentation is available from the normal "Help" link (top-right
corner on the GUI) when viewing the "Un" tab.  The provided examples
are briefly described by the help documentation, but the source code for
the examples is even more helpful.  You can navigate to the plugin
project to find the properties containing the source code for the examples,
but it's better to use "ectool" to copy the source code out to a file
as described in the help text for the plugin.

  Additional help (and eventually examples) is available through the
http://ask.electric-cloud.com/ forum -- post your questions, concerns,
comments, example, feedback, criticism, and complaints.

Change Information
------------------

  Version 1.7 adds the ability to have up to 11 total unplug pages, each
of which can contain unique content (and using the standard tabs mechanism,
can appear anywhere in the Commander GUI).  An additional optional view
is provided that displays a top level unplug tab with 8 subtabs, each of
which shows one of the provided examples (at least until you change that).
Some minor bugfixes were also performed (the "Hello Earthling" example
now does property expansion correctly, and the parameter panel example
can be used standalone as well as a parameter panel).
